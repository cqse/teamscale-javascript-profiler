# Architecture Decision Records 

We use Architecture Decision Records (ADR) for documenting all
decision in the development process that affect or constraint 
its functionality or the architecture of the system.

These records answer the WHY: Why has a problem solved in 
a particular way? Why has a specific technology be chosen? 

A record should be created whenever significant effort
was spent to come up with a design decision.

The focus of an ADR is on the decision and not no the
decision history.
